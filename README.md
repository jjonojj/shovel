# shovel

**note: this project is a work in progress and 80% of the interpreter isnt implemented yet.**

a work in progress programming language written in c. i originally started it because i wanted to learn more about programming languages and how they work.

## building:

**linux**:

```sh
make
```

**windows**:

not officially supported, but will probably work with mingw64 or with wsl

## ---

the syntax of the programming language is not really defined yet, but i want it to look something like this:

```c

void main() {
    int x = 5;
    print("hai");
}

```

im not sure if it will have a type system yet so the above code is subject to change.
